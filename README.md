# **Programming Algorithms**
A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. An algorithm works by following a procedure, made up of inputs. Once it has followed all the inputs, it will see a result, also known as output.  

## Characteristics of an algorithm:

- **Precision:** the steps are precisely stated.
- **Uniqueness:** results of each step are uniquely defined and only depend on the input and the result of the preceding steps.
- **Finiteness:** the algorithm stops after a finite number of instructions are executed.
- **Input:** the algorithm receives input.
- **Output:** the algorithm produces output.
- **Generality:** the algorithm applies to a set of inputs.
